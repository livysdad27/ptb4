This module provides input event classes.  Input event objects are used
to consolidate all necessary information about input events in a clean
way.

You normally don't need to use input event objects directly.  Input
events are handled automatically in each frame of the SGE's main loop.
You only need to use input event objects directly if you take control
away from the SGE's main loop, e.g. to create your own loop.

       The number of the joystick, where ``0`` is the first joystick.

       The type of joystick control that was moved.  Can be one of the
       following:

       - ``"axis-"`` -- The tilt of a joystick axis to the left or up
         changes.

         down changes.
       - ``"hat_center_y"`` -- Whether or not a joystick hat is
         vertically centered changes.
